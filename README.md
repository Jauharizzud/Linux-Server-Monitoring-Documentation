# Linux-Server-Monitoring-Documentation

This is a simple project for learning about **network monitoring**.  
I use **Prometheus** and **Grafana** to collect and visualize the data.

## What I Did
- Installed Prometheus for monitoring.
- Installed Grafana for dashboard visualization.
- Connected Prometheus as data source in Grafana.
- Made a simple dashboard to see network performance.

## Goal
The goal of this project is just to practice and understand how network monitoring works using open-source tools.

Made as part of my journey in learning system administration.

Made with warm coffee on this rainy starry night and a lot of trial and error.
